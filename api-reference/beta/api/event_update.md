## Request body
In the request body, supply the values for relevant fields that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values.

Since the **event** resource supports [extensions](../../../concepts/extensibility_overview.md), you can use the `PATCH` operation to 
add, update, or delete your own app-specific data in custom properties of an extension in an existing **event** instance.

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and updated [event](../resources/event.md) object in the response body.
